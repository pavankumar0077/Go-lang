1st go program
--
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Hello Pavan")
}

```
1) In any programming language to run the program the language will find entrypiont of it
where entire program will start executing. Ex: in java PSVM in Go also same it uses
func main(){
}

2) To get or find print statement we have inform the program that print method is in
"fmt" package, import "fmt" -- it will provides methods to print the string.
we need to use fmt.Print("Hello Go")

3) Now we need to mention which main method, Like main maybe present in many places.
Main method make sure it should be in main package, Go will find main package and execute the
main method.
package main -- it will find entry point and execute it
