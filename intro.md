```
For System design or system level software -- we use C or C++
When dev's are working on a project then found issues and that issues are not even
solved by C or C++

The issues are
1) Memory managment
2) Security
3) Go comiplation

To solve the above issues then found a own and new prog language called GO
NOTE: DOCKER & KUBERNETES are completely written by using Go lang.

```
1) Multi-Purpose Language -- Used for both system level development and web development
Rest api, system level like docker kubernetes

2) Compiled Language -- Before execution code will be compiled so execution will be faster
as compared to interpreted lang python

3) Static & Strongly Typed -- Static means like we need to mention which datatype the varibale is like
int a, String name -- as Java.
Strongly means -- In java we have concept called Type conversion ex: when we are converting any higher level data type to
lower level we use Type casting int to byte like that. But in Go it is not possible.
We have do expicitly not typecasting or conversion in Go.

4) Faster compilation -- It comiles the go faster

5) Simple & Readable -- Like python, easily readable, less verbose code

6) Object oriented like -- It will not support complete object oriented programming lang
but through methods, interface, pointer and some other concepts it feels like OOP lang
Here we don't have anything like classes like java

7) Pointers -- Pointers in Go is somewhat easy so compare to C lang, here we have auto gragable
collection to auto clean the memory that are in Go. Big advantage

8) Open-Source Commmunity -- We have good community for Go.
